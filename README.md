## Mandarin Tone Recognition using multi-class SVMs

The goal of this mini-project is to implement a multi-class SVM prediction on an H7 board to identify which tone the audio text file is saying/pronouncing. The training of the SVM model was done on Google Colab and the weights were imported over to CubeIDE, which is where the code was worked on and implemented.
